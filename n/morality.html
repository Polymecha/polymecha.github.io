            What is morality?
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Well I'd argue that it's just what the general consensus among people is. For example, in murder, there are negative feelings associated with a dead body, so it is naturally illegal, and an immoral action.</p>
          <p>I feel that in the end, a country's government also has a play in the topic. For some people, if they're robbing a convenience store and they're very poor, then in their perspective, they're just surviving. But then for the government,  it needs to punish those people in order to keep functioning. Because if everyone stole, then there wouldn't be much money to go around (and ultimately get to the country).</p>
          <p>Can morality ever be objective? Well for that, I would imagine there would probably have to be some handbook that people are FORCED to follow, in which case I think a tyrannical country fits this description. Not necessarily a dictatorship, but maybe a certain variation of communism.</p>
          <p>I think that, if we go back to caveman times, you'd see that there's barely any guilt associated with actions that would be "illegal" in the modern age. I think this is because we're hard-wired to do whatever we need to do to survive.</p>
